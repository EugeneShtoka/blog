A Warm Shalom from sunny Israel!

I'm Eugene, a passionate engineer who always has a coding project (or two) simmering.

Growing up in Israel, the sea and technology have always fascinated me. There's something about the power of code, like the rhythm of a breaking wave... And let me tell you, nothing quite beats chasing waves with surfboard! But that's not all that gets my heart pumping. Capoeira, salsa – you name it, if it has rhythm, I'm hooked!

And of course, my trusty Boston Terrier is my ultimate chill buddy. Oh, and my electronic keyboard? It's not just about the music – it's my coding brain's way of playing a different tune!
